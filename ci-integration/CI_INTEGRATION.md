### **Summary of the Jenkinsfile**


1. **Checkout**: The pipeline checks out the latest code from the source control repository (e.g., GitHub).

2. **Build**: The Maven build is triggered, which compiles the project, installs dependencies, and performs a dependency analysis, but skips tests during the build process.

3. **Test Execution**: In this stage, a Docker container is launched with the Docker image, and tests are executed using Maven. The tests are run in the selected browser (Chrome or Firefox), which is passed as an environment variable. If the tests fail, the build result is marked as `UNSTABLE`.

4. **Post-Test Actions**: After the tests run, the results are:
    - Archived and saved as artifacts 
    - Uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket
    - A report URL is generated

5. **Generate Report Dashboard**: An HTML report is generated and published

6. **Failure Handling**: If any stage fails, an email is sent to the QA team with information about the failure.

7. **Workspace Cleanup**: The workspace is cleaned up after the pipeline execution.

### **Two Ways to Integrate into a CI Pipeline**

#### 1. **Webhooks from Version Control**

A webhook can be configured in a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) to automatically trigger the Jenkins pipeline every time a change is made in the repository. This could be when a commit is pushed, or a pull request (PR) is created/updated.
(I would advise for pull requests only, because triggering for every branch event would consume a lot of resources.)

**Benefits**:
- Immediate feedback with every change.
- Ensures that tests are automatically executed after every commit or PR.

#### 2. **Jenkins Multi-Branch Pipeline or PR Triggers**

Jenkins can be set up with a multi-branch pipeline or PR-specific triggers. This can also be used for feature branches where tests should run before merging.

**Benefits**:
- Tests are only executed when necessary (on PRs or branch changes).
- Ensures pull requests are tested before merging into the main branch, maintaining code quality.
