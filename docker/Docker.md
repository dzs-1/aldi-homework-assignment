### Explain what Docker is and how it can be beneficial for a QA engineer. Provide a simple example of how you would set up an automated testing environment using Docker.

Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all it's dependencies into a unit called a container. 
It's like a virtual machine that contains everything needed to run your tests consistently across any environment.

#### Benefits for QA:
 - Consistent environments
 - Isolated testing - clean environment for every suite
 - Parallel test execution
 - Easy environment setup - one command to set up the infrastructure
 - Version control for environments
